<h1>HW 4 Report</h1>

<h2>Domain Selection and Experiment Design</h2>
For our experiment, we selected the domain of tech companies and chose the top companies that a majority of people are aware of to be considered. The selected examples were <b>Samsung, Huawei, Tesla, Oracle, Intel, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google</b>. 

To evaluate these companies, we conducted individual interviews, each focusing on a different attribute.

<h2>Attributes Considered</h2>
Each of us conducted one interview without sharing the results, and evaluated different attributes that were used in the final analysis grid. The attributes considered were:

- market cap 
- revenue
- profit margin
- innovation
- brand recognition
- diversity
- sustainability
- employee happiness

<h2>Results</h2>

The interviews showed interesting results, with some common clustering of attributes and pairing of companies. 

We observed that 

- **Amazon** clustered with **Facebook**
- **Apple** clustered with **Google**
- **Oracle** clustered with **Intel**
- **Microsoft** and **Tesla** did not cluster with any other company

This trend was observed in all the interviews conducted.

The clustering of attributes was distinct, as only the attributes that had some correlation were clustered together. 

**Revenue** and **brand recognition** were clustered together most of the time as there exists a significant relation between them. 

Other significant clusters that we formed were **diversity** and **market cap** and **profit margins** and **sustainability**

Another interview produced a different set of clusters, where **sustainability** and **employee happiness** were clustered together. This could be explained as a thriving company having happier employees and vice versa.

**Tesla** was a constant outlier, with its attributes scoring either very high or very low. Interviewers gave low ratings for employee happiness, which could be attributed to the fact that all other companies were predominantly tech companies, while Tesla is an automobile company.

**Apple** and **Google** were almost always clustered together, which makes sense given that their origins and mode of operation are similar. The constant competition between them in operating systems, browsers, and other products further strengthens their clustering. On the other hand, the clustering of Oracle with Intel had only one similarity - that they are legacy companies. This could be attributed to the difference in the perception of the users for each company.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In conclusion, the experiment showed that some attributes have a significant correlation, and the companies were clustered accordingly. The clustering also showed some insights into the perception of the users for each company.
